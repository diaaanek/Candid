\*\*\* Currently under construction. To continue this app, I would integrate my /signup /signin forms with my routes, as well as the ability to create and edit quizzes.

### Challenges

Coming from a NoSQL background, database design was a struggle for me in firebase. I will continue learning and implementing restructure of my database schema. Another challenge was attempting responsiveness without the use of a framework.

Topics include:

- Custom Routing
- Integrating Firebase
- Managing state
- Registering users, Firebase for Google OAuth login
- Logging users in and out
- Creating, editing, and deleting interview questions from Firebase real time database
