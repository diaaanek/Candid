      "title": "What is a closure in Javascript?",
      "answer": "A closure is when a function is bound to its calling function and has access to the variables in the parent scope.\n\nCommon example:\n\n**Write a for loop that creates a list of functions that spit out the current number of the iteration**\n\n```\nfunction iterate(k) {\n    var funcs = [];\n    for(var i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n      (function(num) {\n        funcs.push(function() {\n          return num;\n        });\n      })(i);\n    }\n    return funcs;\n  }\n\n  const test = f(4);\n  console.log(test[0]()); // 0\n  console.log(test[1]()); // 1\n  console.log(test[2]()); // 2\n  console.log(test[3]()); // 3\n```"

      "answer": "A callback function is a reference to a function that is called after a certain action is complete. Used heavily for handling AJAX requests in the past.\n\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nvar a = function() {\n  console.log('a called');\n};\nvar b = function(callback) {\n  setTimeout(200, callback);\n};\n\nb(a);\n'a is called' will appear after 200 ms\n```"

If not cached, the request will the forwarded to the top-level DNS servers\n- After resolving the destination IP, the server will process the HTTP GET request and return a payload\n- Browser will process the payload and start to render the page\n- Browser will process all the subrequests (CSS, images, Javascript) from the payload and send GET requests separately"
