# Data type vs data structure

each data point is related to every
classes - hold data, not a structure

# Categories of Data Structres (Model relationships of real life things)

## Lists - linear data (array straight line), stores continuously and has data (linked lists), stored in line & has order, uses => storing data of the same type, storing data in a specific order, operations that require knowledge of size, modeling thats that have an order

- Arrays
- Linked Lists -> composed of nodes that contain data and a reference to the next node
- Stacks -> last in vs out, Call Stack

- Queues -> Lines, first in first out

model data

Write a function that can detect whether or not

## Maps - hashes/JS objects, data is stored non-contiguously and is unordered. uses => need access to specific data points, multiple pieces of data about one thing, storing different data types

## Graphs - nonlinear data (trees)

- Modeling relationships between similar things that need to know about other similar things
